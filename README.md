## Benchmark install
The CVIT benchmark we have constructed encompasses 10 datasets along with their corresponding instruction sets.
### Instruction Tuning Files
You can download instruction tuning files of our CVIT benchmark from [CVIT benchmark](https://huggingface.co/datasets/zackie29/SMoLoRA) 

### Dataset Images
All datasets used in the benchmark are publicly available. You can download the corresponding images directly from each dataset’s official website.

## Training and Evaluation
The training and evaluation code for SMoLoRA will be released soon.
